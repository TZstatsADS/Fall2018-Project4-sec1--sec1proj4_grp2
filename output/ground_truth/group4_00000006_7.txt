EXHIBIT M
REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS
RICHARD L. WILSON
The CMA Communications Department has one primary objective;
to increase recognition that the chemical industry is committed
to act responsibly to protect the public from the health and
safety risks of its products -- and thereby to develop public
support for the industry's public policy positions.
The departÂ­
ment is an integral part of the CMA umbrella function of advocacy.
CMA's communications activities are instrumental in shaping
public understanding and public support.
From this understanding
and support evolves government controls and issue-related laws
The department is interlocked with and supporÂ­
tive of every other CMA department and committee through every
step of the public policy process.
The CMA Communications Committee (made up of the top proÂ­
fessionals in the industry) monitors department activities and
helps in program development.
The comprehensive program includes:
ADVERTISING - The CMA two-year old advertising program produced
measurable results, as tested by Cambridge Reports in its third
wave public opinion poll earlier this year.
Almost half the
."political active" sample surveyed were aware of the CMA communiÂ­
cation in the magazines in which the ads appeared.
of the communications gave the industry better marks (13 percentage
points) for its efforts on waste disposal than those who were not.
For the first time since 1980, the proportion of politically
active individuals who feel the industry is concerned about the
average person's welfare (47%) nearly equals those viewing the
industry as unconcerned.
The current creative strategy -- to demonstrate the chemical
industry commitment through the personal concern of individual
industry people by showing their dual role as concerned parent and
worker -- will be used for the remainder of this calendar year.
These ten human-interest advertisements appear in Time, Newsweek,
Angeles Times and The Washington Post.
In two years these ads have
generated almost a quarter of a million requests for the "key
issues" booklets and additional information.

The section is coordinating
an even more aggressive media tour schedule during the current
media tour "season."
Between June 1932 and May 1983, media
tour spokespersons should visit approximately 90 primary cities.
News materials distribution includes special newsfeatures and
opinion pieces for print media; issue backgrounders; special reÂ­
ports from ChemEcology; news releases; booklets and pamphlets;
and distribution of "The Chemical Industry Facts File."
The Section has begun production of special communications
materials on such key issues as water and hazardous waste.
The
first of these was a package of materials on water issues, deÂ­
signed for use or adaptions by member companies at the local level.
Included in this package were: a model speech and press release;
backgrounders on water issues; suggested questions and answers for
media interviews; video film clips.
Similar packages on other
issues -- including hazardous waste disposal -- are planned.
The Section will produce a special monthly newsletter to
and reports on major issues.
Another newsletter is planned for
members of the press to keep them up to date on issues.
Radio operations include: THE REPORT, a series of threeminute newsfeatures, distributed biweekly to a 1,500-station
posal and siting, energy, clean air and water issues, and other
'chemical related subjects.
