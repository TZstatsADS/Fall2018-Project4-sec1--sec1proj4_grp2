advocacy. To the extent the industry's priorities for these
organizations change or significantly evolve, a further examination and
some additional actions and recommendations will be required.

CMA priorities should be on strengthening existing CICs rather
than creating new ones at this time. CMA should carefully
consider how the Industry should be collectively represented
in those states without CICs and where there is a distinct

to have a CMA state lobbyist on a retained basis where
circumstances warrant?

The focus of such CMA funding should be on supporting those
programs and priorities of the chemical industry which are of
interstate and national significance. Funding for ongoing
