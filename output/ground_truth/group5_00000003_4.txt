ADVOCACY OVERVIEW
Congress
The President's offensive to hold the line on federal spending, fend
off tax increases and quell the demand for trade protection will probably
result in a number of vetoes this fall. Aides have reportedly begun
laying the groundwork for possible confrontation with Congress over
spending bills "in order to protect the economy."
After a lengthy debate, House and Senate conferees reached agreement
on the first Budget Resolution for FY 1986, later adopted by the full
Administration and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, who
testified that this amount in deficit reduction in FY 86 would be
necessary to keep interest rates from rising.
A Cabinet shakeout appears likely to kicked off by the departure of
Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler, possibly being
replaced by Jack Svahn, the White House domestic policy chief. Another
Cabinet member said to be targeted for replacement is Agriculture
Secretary John Block. In the aftermath of President Reagan's surgery for
cancer, White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan has been presiding
over Cabinet meetings before the President arrives to sit in.
The President will make trips out of town three or four days a month
to promote his tax reform plan and to stump for Republican candidates
facing reelection.
focussed on trade. The protectionist legislation proposed thus far is
directed chiefly against the Japanese, while the trade deficit with Canada
and Europe is growing at a increased rate.
The Congressional adjournment date is uncertain, with several
Federal Regulatory Agencies
Recently settled enforcement cases dramatize EPA's increased emphasis
on rigorous enforcement of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

Although EPA has been inspecting for compliance with all sections of TSCA,
the largest fines have been levied for violations of the premanufacture
notice and reporting provisions of TSCA. In one recent settlement, a
substantial fine was reduced because the company voluntarily disclosed the
violations and agreed to perform a company-wide audit for compliance with
TSCA.
Since late June, EPA has been preparing a list of hazardous
substances that it believes should be stringently controlled. Draft lists
criteria. The list, expected to be published during September, will
probably cover 100-200 substances, which will be the targets of EPA and
OSHA inspections.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
On May 30, 1985, FERC moved to stimulate competition in natural gas
markets by publishing a rule. Some parts of the rule are objectionable,
but overall it could improve access to reserves from the outer continental
shelf.
OSHA's new draft instruction (CPL 2.65) to Field Officers will
establish a National Pilot Program for inspecting chemical plant
processes. Field Officers are now being trained to conduct process safety

The Congress is increasingly angry about the ever worsening trade
situation, but frustrated in finding a solution. The Representative
Gibbons (H.R. 2451) bill dealing with the use of natural resources is
strongly opposed by the Administration and parts of the business

3035) to impose a 25 percent surcharge on imports has gained many
supporters but is considered to be too extreme. The many anti-Japanese

The U.S. continues to promote a new GATT round of tariff and non­
tariff bargaining, it is winning support in Europe and with other
countries. The Congress is reluctant but does not yet have the
Administration's request for authority to proceed. This is predicted to
come yet this fall with negotiations proposed to start in 1986. CMA is
preparing its policy recommendations for the legislative process and for
the negotiation phase.
The expected U.S. trade deficit of 5150 billion in 1985 is lamented
States
In 1985, the National Conference of State Legislatures polled more
than 300 legislative leaders and legislative research directors asking
and tax concerns ranked as the top issues for virtually every legislative
agenda. Some states face tight budgets and are searching for new
revenues. Others are considering the allocation of budget surpluses, tax
reform and tax cuts.
In the natural resources area, the survey cited hazardous wastes as a
