review of DEHA toxicity data and developing a voluntary testing

organized and funded to address EPA's concerns, the FDATG activi­

CMA staff, with advice from the Chemical Regulations
Advisory Committee (CRAC) and interested company representatives,
negotiated with EPA and EDP to gather information on the 50-ppm

Since CRAC's budget could not
support the data-gathering efforts, Che Special Programs Division
was asked to assume responslbillcy for this project*

The PCB Panel is conducting two surveys of its member com­
panies: 1) 50 ppm incidental generation survey - to characterize
ly enclosed survey - to identify the numbers of pieces of elec­
trical equipment which contain PCBs, the volume of such PCBs, and
cussing the problems and costs associated with low level PCB

The Rubber Additives Program Panel was formed in March 1980
to sponsor research that would expand the .toxicological data base
on rubber chemicals of interest to participating companies.
The panel works in close cooperation with both the WTR
(International Working Group on Rubber Chemical Toxicology) and
Che Rubber Manufacturers Association. All three groups have been
concerned with nltrosamlnes in the workplace and the panel is

primary concern was a long-term inhalation study. A contract was
signed in 1975 with Industrial BIO-TEST Laboratories (1BT) to
conduct such a study. The testing performed by IBT resulted in a

Therefore, the CMA TCE Audit Task Group prepared an audit r port.
