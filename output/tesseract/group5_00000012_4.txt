In 1997 energy lssues Will be more

. Increaslng v.5. dependency on forelgn energy sources;
. Deterloratlo of the v.5. trade balance and,
Key Issues. As mentloned earller, 011 and gas costs are more than
25% of flnal emlcal product costs, whlch 15 the hlghest of all
manufacturlng actors. Any actlons that ralse 011 and gas costs by
such a level .Ve a great unpact on the chemlcal 1ndustry. As an
then 011 and as costs would Increase 55 bllllon/year. Key Issues that
may affect energy and petrochemlcal feedstock costs are llsted below:
. 011 Import axes and Energy Securlty. The prlmary energy
lssue Will be 011 import taxes and energy securlty measures.
