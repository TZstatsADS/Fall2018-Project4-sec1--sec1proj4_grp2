Proposed Research Program on Carcinogenic Potential of mel Chloride EXHIBIT A purpose The purpose of this program 15 to provide sclentlflc 1nfomatlon to clarify the status of Vinyl chloride (monomer) in reference to carclnogenlclty. Proj eat As recommended by an Ad Hoc Planning Group for mel Chloride Research. composed of representatives of eight MCA member companies, the project 15 to contract for annual testi mY research under which experimental annuals would 1nhale Vinyl chloride monomer Vapor at selected concentration levels and be examined in accord with an agreediupon testing and examination protocol. Planned duration of the project 15 three years. According to quotations from Industrial closest Laboratorles, Inc., with which the contract is in prospect, and an allowance for Vinyl chloride supply and contingencies, the projected cost 15 $193,000. Funding Funding commitments have been recelved from seventeen MCA member companies sufficient in the aggregate to cover the stated cost. Company shares are proirated on the basis of publicly announced tonnage production capacity for Vinyl chloride monomer plus polyvinyl chloride. lsbursements are to be subject to MCA staff clearance an approval. The ogram 15 m be supervised on MCA'S behalf by a plus an MCA staff representative to serve as secretary. CMA 03522 For purpose made solely hrough MCA, nomany based on Task Group reef ommendations as to nature and timing. not preclude reLate sclentlflc interchange of nonicompetltlve is would be an obligation to inform the MCA staff representai Operation The Task Group 1 to be governed by the requlrements of MCA CMA 035229
