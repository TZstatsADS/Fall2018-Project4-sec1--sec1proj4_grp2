### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files.

In main.Rmd, most chunks are set to eval = FALSE. You could just run those chunks without eval = FALSE to regenerate results since all required data is stored and loaded as Rdata. Or you could run chunks with eval = FALSE to regenerate these Rdata file, which may take much time.

In main.Rmd, the last chunk is about using iteration to improve our correction. This chunk is fully functionable but you may not want to run it because it would take very long time.
